# Welcome
At AnyDevCode headquarters, MDCDEV and GalleNiz are immersed in an intense discussion about the next software development project. The atmosphere is filled with the characteristic emotion of two creative minds passionate about programming.

We handle languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Haxe, and more!

Our focus is to develop programs to deliver our brand from everyone to everyone.
